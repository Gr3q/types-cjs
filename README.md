# types-cjs

Typescript declarations for CJS - Cinnamon JavaScript 

## Usage

This only works on a system where Cinnamon DM is installed and running off of Cinnamon's JS engine.

To use the the declarations create a file named `ci.d.ts` in your project with the contents:

```ts
import "@ci-types/cjs";
```
